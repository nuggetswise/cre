### How This App Works
This application helps commercial real estate professionals analyze lease agreements and build automated workflows.

**Process Flow:**
1. **Input** - Choose a lease agreement (generate new, upload, or use sample)
2. **Analysis** - AI extracts key lease information
3. **Workflow Design** - Generate automation steps across multiple systems
4. **Value Assessment** - Calculate ROI and business impact

Each step builds on the previous one to create a complete solution.
